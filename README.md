# Introduction to Financial Mathematics

This repository contains code and materials from the "Introduction to Financial Mathematics" course, held at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology**.

The course covered fundamental concepts and practical applications in financial mathematics, with a strong emphasis on computational methods. Key topics included:

* **Random Number Generators and Testing:** Exploration of various methods for generating pseudo-random numbers and techniques for statistically testing their quality and randomness.
* **CRR Market and MCMC Estimation:** Analysis of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial market model, including the estimation of payoffs using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods.
* **Black-Scholes Market and MCMC Estimation:** In-depth study of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing and the application of MCMC techniques for estimating payoffs in this continuous-time market.
* **Variance Reduction Techniques:** Investigation of methods to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations, such as antithetic variates and control variates.
* **MCMC Estimation Methods:** Comprehensive coverage of various Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms and their practical implementation for financial modeling and estimation tasks.
